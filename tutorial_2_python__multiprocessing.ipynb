    "### Consumers-Producer Example\n",
    "A more complex example shows how to manage several workers consuming data from a `JoinableQueue` and passing results back to the parent process. The poison pill technique is used to stop the workers. After setting up the real tasks, the main program adds one “stop” value per worker to the job queue. When a worker encounters the special value, it breaks out of its processing loop. The main process uses the task queue’s join() method to wait for all of the tasks to finish before processing the results."
